                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Felix Asare and am a part time student in the Full Stack Web Development program with
                        UT
                        Austin. Usually Felix try his very best to skip talking about me since it is one of the areas
                        am
                        not really good at. However, this is better than standing up in class stammering my way through
                        so
                        Felix will give it my best shot.</p>

                    <p>Felix is originally from Ghana but moved to the United States early January 2009 and resided in
                        New
                        York City until he joined the United States Army in 2012 working as a Culinary Specialist where
                        he
                        was able to learn many skills especially on creativity. Commitment and hard-work has always
                        been
                        his hallmark and this was rewarded with many honors in a very fast and harsh working
                        environment.
                        Felix completed his Bachelors Degree in Sports Management at St Johns University and before
                        that a
                        Diploma in Marketing at Accra Polytechnic.</p>

                    <p>Felix has always have the passion of how the internet work and that led his path to enroll in
                        the UT
                        Website Development certificate program. Not only is Felix a skilled and detailed oriented
                        person
                        but he is also very compassionate. In his free time, he likes to be active and seek adventure
                        at
                        all times. He also spend a lot of time looking at new technologies and playing with it to see
                        how
                        he can upgrade or create a project of his own.</p>
